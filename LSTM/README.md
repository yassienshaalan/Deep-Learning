##### -  1 Overview
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited to time series prediction. Given the importance of sales prediction in business, LSTMs can be a powerful tool when utilized properly. In this repository, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LSTMs in predicting sales.
